<h2>Objective:</h2>

Create a model that predicts whether or not a loan will be default using historical data.

<h3>Problem Statement:</h3>
For companies like Lending Club correctly predicting whether or not a loan will be a default is very important. In this project, using historical data from 2007 to 2015, you have to build a deep learning model to predict the chance of default for future loans.

As you will see later, this dataset is highly imbalanced and includes a lot of features that make this problem more challenging.

Domain: Finance

Analysis to be done: Perform data preprocessing and build a deep learning prediction model.


<h3>Steps to perform: </h3>
Perform exploratory data analysis and feature engineering and then apply feature engineering. Follow up with a deep learning model to predict whether or not the loan will be default using the historical data.

<h3>Tasks:</h3>

**Feature Transformation**

* Transform categorical values into numerical values (discrete)
* Exploratory data analysis of different factors in the dataset.


**Additional Feature Engineering**

You will check the correlation between features and drop those features that have a strong correlation. ‚óè This will help reduce the number of features and leave you with the most relevant features.

**Modeling**

After applying EDA and feature engineering, you are now ready to build the predictive models. 
In this part, you will create a deep learning model using Keras with Tensorflow backend.
